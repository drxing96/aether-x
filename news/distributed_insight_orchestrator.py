def integrate_distributed_insights(news_articles):
    """
    Integrates raw news articles with aether-framework synergy modules for
    distributed analysis and node-based negotiation. Returns a synergy-based
    summary string reflecting multi-agent processing.

    Steps:
    ------
    1. Instantiate a SynergyCoordinator from synergy_coordinator.
    2. Assign tasks to nodes, referencing the content from 'news_articles.'
    3. Optionally trigger swarm behavior and signal propagation to mimic
       advanced distributed analysis.
    4. Produce a final "distributed insight" text block that can be appended
       to your GPT prompt or logs.

    :param news_articles: list of dict, each representing a fetched news article
    :return: str - a synergy-based summary describing multi-agent outcomes
